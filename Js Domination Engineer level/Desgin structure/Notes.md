✅ What is Modularization Pattern in JavaScript?

Modularization (Module Pattern) is a design structure where you break your JavaScript code into independent, reusable parts (modules).
Each module contains its own data and functions, and only exposes what is necessary.

It helps you avoid:
messy code
global variable pollution
repeating code
difficult debugging

⭐ Why Modularization is Used
Organizes large projects
Makes code reusable
Protects internal data (encapsulation)
Prevents naming conflicts
Improves readability
